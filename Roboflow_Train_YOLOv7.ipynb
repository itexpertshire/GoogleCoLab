        "### Step 1: Creating project\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you start, you need to create a Roboflow [account](https://app.roboflow.com/login). Once you do that, you can create a new project in the Roboflow [dashboard](https://app.roboflow.com/). Keep in mind to choose the right project type. In our case, Object Detection.\n",
